A Weather Forecast Application where you can search any city for temperature, weather conditions, humidity and wind speed. This app makes use of openweathermap API for fetching data.

How to use--->
-Keep all files in the same folder or change the source to absolute path if they are at different locations.
-Get your API key from https://openweathermap.org/ and paste it in place of given apiKey in engine.js file.
-For search icon, I have used React Icons extension in Visual Studio Code for getting the SVG code.
